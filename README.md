### Problem Statement: Personalized Product Recommendations

Team Hackapotamous aims to enhance the user experience by implementing a personalized product ranking system. This project is built as a part of the Flipkart GRiD 5.0.
We developed an algorithm or model that can generate accurate and relevant product rankings for individual users, using KNN algorithm and the cosine similarity metric. The ranking system considers factors such as user
preferences, past interactions. It predicts the most suitable products for a user based on their unique characteristics and preferences.

## Motivation:
With online shopping and e-commerce becoming an integral part of our day-to-day life, it is time that Artificial Intelligence take root into the experience of online shopping. 

## Solved Problems:
## Information Overload: 
Traditional e-commerce platforms often overwhelm users with extensive product catalogs. Our platform solves this by utilizing personalized recommendations, ensuring users are presented with products most relevant to their preferences and interests.
